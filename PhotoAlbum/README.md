# Future learning

### Logic for moving between photos  
* Using a collection or structure to hold the photos and their data would look and work better than the _when_ statements that change during button taps

### Light vs dark mode
* I got some things to work, but I'd like to be able to customize more for light and dark mode

### Transitions
* It would be fun to flip through the photos by fading or swiping
