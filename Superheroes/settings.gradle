We recommend using a newer Android Gradle plugin to use compileSdkPreview = "UpsideDownCake"

This Android Gradle plugin (8.0.0) was tested up to compileSdk = 33.

You are strongly encouraged to update your project to use a newer
(stable or preview) Android Gradle plugin that has been tested with compileSdkPreview = "UpsideDownCake".

If you are already using the latest preview version of the Android Gradle plugin,
you may need to wait until a newer version with support for compileSdkPreview = "UpsideDownCake" is available.

To suppress this warning, add/update
    android.suppressUnsupportedCompileSdk=UpsideDownCake
to this project's gradle.properties.
